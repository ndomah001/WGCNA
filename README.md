# Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
## ‚ùì What is WGCNA?
Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a systems biology method used to analyze gene expression data by constructing networks that represent gene co-expression relationships. This approach helps identify clusters of genes with similar expression patterns and explores the relationships between these clusters and external traits or conditions.

WGCNA is particularly useful for identifying gene modules that are associated with complex traits and for gaining insights into the underlying biology of the system being studied.

A typical workflow looks something like this:



## üìù Study Design
I will be performing a WGCNA on RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a group of 17 COVID-19 subjects and 17 healthy controls ([GSE152418](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE152418)).

**Goals**:
- Identify what modules (genes or clusters of genes) that are significantly associated with COVID-19 individuals.
- Identify genes that are significantly associated with *severe* COVID-19 cases.
